### Option 4: Copy from Existing Project
If you have the original `sirganguly.jpg` from your existing project, you can:
1. Copy it to `assets/avatars/computer-teacher.png`
2. Use it as a template for other avatars
3. Modify or create variations for different professions

## Temporary Solution:
For immediate testing, you can use the existing `sirganguly.jpg` file:
1. Copy `sirganguly.jpg` to `assets/avatars/computer-teacher.png`
2. Create copies for other avatars with different names
3. Replace with proper avatars later

## Example Commands:
```bash
# Copy existing image as placeholder
cp ../sirganguly.jpg assets/avatars/computer-teacher.png
cp ../sirganguly.jpg assets/avatars/english-teacher.png
cp ../sirganguly.jpg assets/avatars/biology-teacher.png
# ... repeat for all avatars
```

Once you have the avatar images, the application will work fully with the multi-avatar selection feature!
